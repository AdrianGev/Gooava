Finding the name for this language was unironically the hardest part.

Also, this is currently in the works to being a VS Code extension, once school stops throwing 100 mph perfect spiral homework assignments directly into my face.

The extension currently works, I just have to get the compiler working, because I only have the python interpreter working right now.

I have the file extension, and syntax highlighting completed and it all works in experimental development enviornment (run & debug) in VS Code, so stay tuned.
